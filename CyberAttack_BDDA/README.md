# Cyber Attack Project
A cyber attack is an assault launched by cybercriminals using one or more computers against a single or multiple computers or networks. A cyber attack can maliciously disable computers, steal data, or use a breached computer as a launch point for other attacks. Cybercriminals use a variety of methods to launch a cyber attack, including malware, phishing, ransomware, denial of service, among other methods.
Cyber Attacks covered in this problem are:

1). DOS:A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash.

2). U2R: A User to Root attack the attacker first succeeds in gaining a foothold on the remote system in the form of a user session, ideally in the form of an interactive shell or TELNET window.

3). R2L: A Remote to Local attack (sometimes also referred to as a Remote to User attack) is conceptually similar to the user-to-root attack but is more modest in its ultimateambition. Such an attack is transacted when an attacker sends packets to the target host that are intended to disclose vulnerabilities that would enable the attacker to exploit a local user’s privileges.

4).Probe: A probe is an attack which is deliberately crafted so that its target detects and reports it with a recognizable “fingerprint” in the report. The attacker then uses the collaborative infrastructure tolearn the detector’s location and defensive capabilities fromthis report. Probing attacks are intended to disclose information about the vulnerabilities of a target system by performing carefully chosen sequences of operations and observing how the system or the intrusion detection system (IDS) that fronts it behaves in response.

## Dataset Description:
This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, andgood'' normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.
Steps followed for this problem:

i). Data exploration and developing insights with data visualization

ii) Feature engineering--creating new features

iii) Discover if data possess any structure

iv) Data pipelining for data processing and modeling

v) Cross-validation

vi) Hyperparameter tuning both using Grid Search and Randomized Search
